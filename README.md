# MiniProject
This project in entirely theoretical, it has no practical usage. The ASSUMPTION made in the program is that, the imputs are given based on the dataset given in 
the .png file.
The code implements a linked list data structure for storing datasets with color image counts. It provides operations to insert datasets at the front or rear, display the datasets, sort them based on color image counts, count the total datasets, and allows the user to delete a specific node by its color image count. The program runs in an interactive loop, presenting a menu for the user to choose the desired operation until they choose to exit.
